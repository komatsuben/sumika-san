## 🗣 BenHal's Rant
I am creating this project in order to hone my CSS skills(I doubt my abilities). That is why I'm using vanilla CSS. Not only that, I'm also challenging my React.js prowess so that I can still be useful when collaborating with other people.

The design style that I am trying to realize in this web is brutalist? I prioritize on the templating(responsiveness).
